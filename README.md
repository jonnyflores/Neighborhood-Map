##Neighborhood Map project

For this project we had to develop a functioning and interactive map using google API's to get the page up and running, and also use either our own neighborhood or another region. I plan on visiting tokyo, Japan so I went ahead and used travel destinations I am interested in going as the examples.

### Tools Used

I used Google Maps and KnockoutJS for this project. With KnockoutJS I am able to develop a page application capable of running Google MAP API's. KnockoutJS organizes the page using the MVVM, (Model-view-viewmodel), software architectural pattern. Using Foursquare API as well the project can enable real time access to the places listed in the project using the Geocode from Google Maps.
### Completing the Project

I added some stylistic touches to the Map. I added some colors that I feel are pretty popular in Japan to the header and sidebar, as well as the highlighted markers

### Steps to Run the Page

- Download the project file titled Udacity KnockoutJS Project

- Open the index.html in a browser window. (Preferably Chrome)

- app.js file has stored all the locations listed using **lat** and **lng** coordinates.
  Can be replaced with other coordinates around the region and the page will respond seamlessly.

- Interact with the map. Select marker, type in the search bar the names of the listed locations to filter out
  the markers, and zoom in and out to view the rest of the map.
